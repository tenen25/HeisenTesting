# HeisenTesting
Python program to numerically check testing domains in the Heisenberg group described in [BBPT], _Approximations of symbolic substitution systems_.

_**Needed Python libraries:**_
(1) Numpy
(2) itertools
(3) math


_**Parameters needed from user:**_

Parameters needed from the user are fed in the main function. They are:

(1) Underlying stretch factor - 'lamb'.
(2) Iteration number - 'N'.
(3) Set which is known to be a testing domain - 'known_set'.
(4) Set which is suspected to be a testing domain - 'init_set'.

The sets in (3),(4) above are expected to be union of 'z' intervals. Those sets are expected to be given by the user as lists of triples.Each pair in the list is of the form (x,y,z_min),(x,y,z_max), where z_min and z_max are the boundaries of the corresponding 'z'-interval.
The sets are input as lists of triples describing 'z'-intervals. The even or odd entries in the list describe the bottom or upper part of the 'z'-interval accordingly. For example the set $\\{-2,0\\} \times \\{ -4,-2, 0 \\} \times \\{-6,-4,-2,0,2\\}$ can be saved as

// 
[ (-2,-4,-6), (-2,-4,2), (-2,-2,-6), (-2,-2,2), (-2,0,-6), (-2,0,2), (0,-4,-6), (0,-4,2), (0,-2,-6), (0,-2,2), (0,0,-6), (0,0,2)  ]
 //


**Theoretical description of code:**

The program implements Algorithm 1 in [BBPT] to check whether a set is a testing domain for substitution data of the form $\big( \mathcal{A}, \lambda_0, S_0 \big)$ for dilation data $\Big( H_3(\mathbb{R}), d_H, (D_\lambda)_{\lambda>0}, H_3(2\mathbb{Z}), [-1,1)^3  \Big)$. **We note that the user can not change the input dilation datum, as we are only dealing with the same dilation datum in the Heisenberg group.** 
We attach a picture of Algorithm 1 here for the sake of convenience:

![Algorithm 1](https://github.com/tenen25/HeisenTesting/assets/75997072/4ffe97ad-bd8c-41ed-a627-912194068b05)

We recall the meaning of the previous expressions. The action in $H_3(\mathbb{R})$ is given by


$$(x,y,z)\cdot (a,b,c):= \big( x+a, y+b, z+c +\frac{1}{2}(xb-ay) \big). $$

The metric $d_H$ is left invariant metric on $H_3(\mathbb{R})$ satisfying $d_H \big( (x,y,z), (a,b,c)  \big)= \Vert (x,y,z)^{-1} \cdot (a,b,c)  \Vert_{CK} $, with $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{CK}$ being the Cygan-Koranyi norm on $H_3(\mathbb{R})$ given by 

$$ \Vert (x,y,z) \Vert_{CK}:= \sqrt[4]{(x^2+y^2)^2+z^2}. $$

For every $\lambda>0$, $D_\lambda: H_3(\mathbb{R}) \to H_3(\mathbb{R})$ is a dilation given by $D_\lambda(x,y,z)=\big( \lambda x, \lambda y, \lambda^2 z \big)$. $\lambda_0$ is some underlying stretch factor, for which $D_{\lambda_0}$ preserves the lattice $\Gamma:= H_3(2\mathbb{Z})$. $V=[-1,1)^3$ is a fundemantal domain for the lattice $\Gamma$. i.e., $H_3(\mathbb{R})= \underset{\gamma \in \Gamma}{\sqcup} \gamma V$. We denote $D:=D_{\lambda_0}$ for brevity. 

Using these notions, the sets $V(n,M)$, for $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $M\Subset \Gamma$, are defined recursively in [BHP], _Symbolic substitution systems beyond abelian groups_. $V(1,M):= D[M]\cdot D[V]$, and $V(1):=V(1,\{e\})$ is simply $D[V]$. $V(n+1,M)$ is given by $D[V(n,M)\cap \Gamma]\cdot V(1)$. 
Using these notations, the program checks for inputs lamb for underlying stretch factor $\lambda_0\in \mathbb{N}$, N for iteration number $N\in \mathbb{N}$, and two nonempty finite sets $T_1,T_2\subset \Gamma$ whether every $x\in D^N[V]\cap \Gamma$ there exists a $\gamma_x \in \Gamma$ such that

$$ xT_1 \subseteq D^N(\gamma_x) V(N,T_2). $$

To this end we define three checks:

**(1)** The formula $I(x, \gamma, \lambda_0, N, T_2, T_1)$, returning True or False if the following set inclusion holds or not.

$$ xT_1 \subseteq D^N(\gamma) V(N,T_2), $$

which has $x$ and $\gamma$ as parameters. A version of this check is implemented in line 25 of Aux_Check.py . This check implements line 15 in the algorithm.

**(2)** The check

$$ \exists \gamma\in \Gamma \enspace I(x, \gamma, \lambda_0, N, T_2, T_1) , $$

which does not have $\gamma$ as a parameter. This check is implemented by the functions Check_x(x, lamb, N, shifted, fixed) in  Aux_Check.py . This check implements lines 15 to 21 in the algorithm.

**(3)** The check

$$  \forall x\in D^N[V]\cap \Gamma \enspace \exists \gamma\in \Gamma \enspace  I(x, \gamma, \lambda_0, N, T_2, T_1). $$

This is implemented in the function InclCheck(lamb, N, T_2, T_1)  in Aux_Check.py, and does not have $x$ or $\gamma$ as its parameters. This check implements lines 12 to 23 in the algorithm.

Recall that nonempty set $T\Subset \Gamma$ is called  a testing domain if for every radius $r>0$ there exists an index $N_r\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $n>N_r$ and $x\in \Gamma$, there exists $\gamma_x\in \Gamma$ satisfying $x B(e,r) \subseteq D^n(\gamma_x) V(n,T)$. We say $(T,1)$ is a testing tuple, if additionaly $T\subseteq V(1,T)$.

If check (3) holds when  $T_1$ is a testing domain, then we deduce that $T_2$ is also a testing domain. It follows, that if $T_1,T_2,...,T_k \subseteq \Gamma$ are finite nonempty subsets such that InclCheck(lamb, N_j, T_j, T_(j+1)) returns True for all $j$ when $T_1$ is known to be a testing domain, then $T_k$ is also a testing domain. 

Since $D^N[V]\cap \Gamma$ is of the order of $\lambda_0^{4N}$, being the size of $D^N[V]\cap \Gamma$, we can see that the program has at least exponential runtime with respect to $N$. For this reason, we prefer to work with a sequence of checks of the program, rather than a direct application of the program InclCheck(lamb, N, T_1, T_k) for very large $N$.

Furthermore, we modify the algorithm given before to ×™have a more efficient runtime.
To minimize checks and since all sets for which we check set inclusions are a unions of intervals with respect to the 'z' coordinate, these sets are saved as  two connsecutive triples corresponding to the edges of the interval. They are considered as the 'z'-faces of the sets. The set inclusions are checked by whether by inequalities of the 'z'-intervals, since the XY component has an explicit description. Moreover, searching for the possible $z$-coordinate of $\gamma$, reduces to solving when the the 'z'-intervalsof $xT_1$ are contained in 'z'-intervals of $D^N(\gamma_x) V(N,T_2)$. Both these simplifications in this case are further explained in the file _AlgoSimpl.pdf_.  ~~check PDF file explaining change of algorithm for efficiency.~~


_**Current results from the code:**_

We consider the following sets, which we show are testing domains: 

(1) $K = V(1)\cap H_3(2\mathbb{Z})$, 
(2) $K3 = V(2)\cap H_3(2\mathbb{Z})$ for the case when $\lambda_0=3$, 
(3) $T_1 = \\{ -2,0\\}^2\times \\{-12,-10,...,10,12\\}$, 
(4) $T_2 =\\{ 0 , -2 \\}^2 \times \\{-6,-4,...,4,6\\}$, 
(5) $T_3 =\\{ 0 , -2 \\}^2 \times \\{-6,-4,...,2,4\\}$.

For $\lambda_0=4$, the tuple $\big( T_2 ,1\big)$ is a testing tuple. This follows since InclCheck(4, 1, K, T_1) and InclCheck(4, 1, T_1, T_2) both return True.

For $\lambda_0=3$, the tuple $\big( T_3 ,1\big)$ is a testing tuple. This follows since InclCheck(3, 2, K3, K) and InclCheck(3, 2, K, T_3) both return True.

To acheive these results, we have to verify check **(2)** for every $x$, and find a suitable $\gamma$ for every $x$. The corresponing list of gammas to x's are given in the documentation files in this repository as txt files.
